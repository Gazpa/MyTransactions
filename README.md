My Transactions (3H max home task)

- To run the project first you need to npm install in the folder location
- Then run npm start

Tech choices

- Redux is a great choice to keep application state and I have already adquired experience on how to use it

- Redux Thunk is here to handle function as actions dispatches in middleware, so it would check the type that returns each action and handle the ones that are functions

- Redux Forms to manage changes on the forms

- No need here to get react router since the app is pretty simple and does not need a lot of navigation
